* DEMO
** Solidity Contract
   - file =chargingCompanyRawTx.sol=
   - compile with =solc chargingCompanyRawTx.sol --combined-json abi,asm,ast,bin,bin-runtime,clone-bin,devdoc,interface,opcodes,srcmap,srcmap-runtime,userdoc > chargingCompanyRawTx.json=
   - get file =chargingCompanyRawTx.json=
** Deploy contract =.node deploy.js=
   - file =deploy.js=, using =chargingCompanyRawTx.json=
** DONE SetUp Contract
   - get contractAddress from output of =deploy.js=
   - update in tcp_constants
   - initial information for contract, such as stations, and users
     show
   - line-by-line on shell (atm)
   - Simulate car getting into station, needs to lock some tokens
** Connection TCP server-client
** LockFunds and tell server
  - Use events and lockFunds function along with previous connection to server
  - Server checks event, waits for 6 confirmations and returns ok
** Transferring Raws Txs takes place
  - Client prepares them and sends them
  - Server checks and gives ok
** Close channel and TCP connection
  - Server sends Raw Tx before timestamp (go back to add timestamp checking)
